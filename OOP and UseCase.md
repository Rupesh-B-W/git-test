# OOP and Its Usecase:
__Object Oriented Programming(OOP)__ is a programming language model in which object are use rather than method and data than logic.OOP is not programming language like C,C++,Java,Python it is method or rule to write the code. In OOP class,object,data etc are use. In oop we see the each problem like in real world probelms and try to solve it. OOP tries to map code instructions with real world making the code short and easier to understand. It is Solving Problem by creating the objects.

OOP conccept also uses the DRY concepts that is Donot Repeat Yourself. For example:In software there is different page like profile page,home Page,About page etc.Suppose we have to show same navigation bar to all page. In this case we donot write same code in different place.We write the re-use code in one
place from from that we pull that code into different  place.From that work load in changing and deleting will  reduce as well as space.
